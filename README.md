# Code from Udemy course Java Enterprise Edition 8 for Beginners course

You can use this code as a sample to follow along with the course.
This is what you need.
 - Eclipse
 - Mysql Installed
 - Payara server on eclipse and payara plugins for eclipse (google on how there are easy to follow tutorial)
 - add jdbc drivers to payara server (google on how there are easy to follow tutorial)
 - jdbc Drivers used mysql-connector-j-8.0.32
 
 I did not wanted to use NeatBeans and Derby ad data base (that is used by the teacher) so I had to adapt the code, it cost me some time but in the end it was rewarding.
